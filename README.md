# Progress Bars Demo

**Serge Merzliakov**

This is my progress bars demo which is built using the following javascript libraries and tools:


  * React
  * Flux
  * React Bootstrap
  * Gulp
  * Jest


With an honorable mention to the awesome **MacDown** markdown editor for OS X.

### Live Demo

I have deployed the code to my demo server at:

[http://epistatic-demo.com/demo4511.html]()


### The dist directory

Contrary to good practice, I have added some binary artefacts to the repository, to assist in evaluating my work, so there is no need to clone the whole repository and build anything.

The **dist** directory contains a complete, runnable version of the demo.


### Limitations and Caveats

  * Not tested on older browsers
  * Uses the ECMA5.1 syntax, rather than ECMA6
  * I have not added the npm packages into the repository
  * There is only a handful unit tests to highlight how Jest tests are created
  * The final javascript file is not minified - uglify just refused to work for this code (I will figure this out as homework).


### Running the Unit Tests

run the command (from the base or root project directory):

**npm test**

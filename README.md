# Progress Bars Demo

#### By Serge Merzliakov 2016

This is my progress bars demo which is built using the following technologies:


  * React Framework
  * Flux
  * React Bootstrap Components
  * Gulp


With an honorable mention to the awesome MacDown markdown editor for OS X.



### Limitations and Caveats

  * Not tested on older browsers
  * Uses the ECMA5.1 syntax, rather than ECMA6

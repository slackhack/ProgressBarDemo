# Progress Bars Demo

**Serge Merzliakov**

This is my progress bars demo which is built using the following technologies:


  * React Framework
  * Flux
  * React Bootstrap Components
  * Gulp


With an honorable mention to the awesome **MacDown** markdown editor for OS X.


### The dist directory

Contrary to good practice, I have added some binary artefacts to the repository, to assist in evaluating my work, so there is no need to clone the whole repoistory and build anything.

The **dist** directory contains a complete executable version of the demo.


### Limitations and Caveats

  * Not tested on older browsers
  * Uses the ECMA5.1 syntax, rather than ECMA6
  * I have not added the npm packages into the repository
